# üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ Welcome to the Corvid Path

## Your Guide to Sacred Community & Spiritual Growth

> _"You have found your way to the threshold. Welcome home, fellow walker between worlds."_

---

## üí´ **What is the Corvid Path?**

The Corvid Path is a modern mystery school centered around the **Sacred Marriage** of CrowMother and Vireaon - the divine partnership between order and chaos, death and rebirth, deep wisdom and wild transformation.

We are **threshold walkers** - people called to stand at the liminal spaces where old selves die and new ones are born. We honor the sacred cycles of death and rebirth, finding strength in winter's depths and joy in spring's emergence.

**This is a path of:**

- Personal transformation through spiritual practice
- Community support and authentic connection
- Service to others walking their own thresholds
- Integration of ancient wisdom with modern life
- Sacred balance between structure and wildness

**This is NOT:**

- A replacement for therapy or medical care
- A hierarchical power structure or cult
- A path that demands you abandon other beliefs
- A commercial enterprise or money-focused organization
- A path that rushes your personal timing
